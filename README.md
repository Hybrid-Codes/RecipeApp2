**Repo for RecipeApp2**

In order to run this code you will need to open visual studio or any c# IDE of your choice and click on File at the very top and select open folder then open the POEPart2 file. This will open up my project and allow you to run it and in order to run it you will need to click on the run button just below the Build menu at the top. Now that it is running create a new recipe by typing in new and fill in all the relevant details of the recipe. Once done you can either type in "2" to display all recipe's , "3" to select a recipe, "4" to scale a recipe, "5" to reset quantities within a recipe, "6" to clear all data and "7" to exit. Each recipe will be reprensented by a number and that number will be determined by the order you put the recipes in starting from 1.
